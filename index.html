          Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the
          related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved
          from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period. More than 13,800
          of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are
          easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the
          distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.
